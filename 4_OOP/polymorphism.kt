// Polymorphism
// Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms.

// class Dog : Animal() {
//     override fun makeSound() {
//         println("Woof!")
//     }
// }

// class Cat : Animal() {
//     override fun makeSound() {
//         println("Meow!")
//     }
// }

// In this example, both Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal abstract class and provide their own implementation of the makeSound() method, which demonstrates polymorphism.

// Polymorphism allows us to treat objects of different classes in a uniform way, as long as they share a common superclass or interface. This can be useful when writing code that operates on a collection of objects, where the specific type of each object is not known at compile time.
