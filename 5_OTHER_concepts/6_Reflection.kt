// Reflection in Kotlin refers to the ability of a program to inspect and modify its own structure, behavior, and metadata at runtime. It allows you to analyze and manipulate classes, properties, functions, and other elements of your code dynamically, without knowing their names at compile time. Reflection enables advanced features such as dynamically loading classes, invoking methods, accessing properties, and inspecting annotations.

// Here's an overview of key reflection concepts and functionalities in Kotlin:

// 1. **Class References (`::class`)**:
//    - You can obtain a reference to a Kotlin class using the `::class` syntax.
//    - Example: `val clazz = MyClass::class`

// 2. **KClass**:
//    - The `KClass` interface represents the runtime class of a Kotlin type.
//    - You can use it to inspect class metadata such as properties, functions, constructors, annotations, etc.
//    - Example: `val clazz: KClass<MyClass> = MyClass::class`

// 3. **Properties and Functions**:
//    - You can access properties and functions of a class using reflection.
//    - Example: `val property = MyClass::class.memberProperties.find { it.name == "myProperty" }`

// 4. **Constructors**:
//    - Reflection allows you to obtain information about constructors and instantiate objects dynamically.
//    - Example: `val constructor = MyClass::class.primaryConstructor`

// 5. **Calling Functions**:
//    - You can dynamically invoke functions on objects using reflection.
//    - Example: `val result = myObject::class.functions.find { it.name == "myFunction" }?.call(myObject)`

// 6. **Annotations**:
//    - Reflection enables you to inspect annotations applied to classes, properties, functions, etc.
//    - Example: `val annotation = MyClass::class.annotations.find { it.annotationClass == MyAnnotation::class }`

// 7. **Modifying Properties and Functions**:
//    - Reflection allows you to modify properties and functions at runtime.
//    - Example: `property.setter.call(myObject, newValue)`

// Reflection in Kotlin is powerful but should be used judiciously due to its overhead and potential for errors. It's commonly used in frameworks, libraries, and tools that require dynamic introspection and manipulation of code elements. However, excessive reliance on reflection can make code harder to understand, debug, and maintain.

// To use reflection in Kotlin, you need to import the `kotlin.reflect` package. Additionally, be mindful of the limitations and performance implications of reflection, especially in performance-critical applications.
